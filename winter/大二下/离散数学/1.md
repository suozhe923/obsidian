***Proposition(命题)***: a declarative(声明性) sentence that is either true or false (not both)
- Declarative sentence: a sentence that makes a statement, while it does not ask a question or give an order  
- Either true or false: fixed(固定); no variable involved
**Truth value** of a proposition:
- true, denoted by T 
- false, denoted by F.
**Propositional variables**: variables that represent propositions(like p,q,r,s...)
__Compound Propositions(复合命题)__:
- Negation $\lnot$ 
	$\lnot$p is read "not p"
- Conjunction(And) $\land$
	p$\land$q is "p and q"
- Disjunction(Or) $\lor$
- Exclusive or $\oplus$
- Implication $\to$
	p $\to$ q is 
	- if p, then q
	- p implies q
	- p is sufficient for q
	- q is necessary for p
	- q follows from p
	- p only if q
	The converse(逆命题) of p → q is q → p.
	The contrapositive(逆否) of p → q is ¬q → ¬p.
		逆否命题有着相同的 truth value
	The inverse(否) of p → q is ¬p → ¬q.
- Biconditional $\leftrightarrow$
	- p if and only if q
	- p is necessary and sufficient for q
	- if p then q, and conversely
	- p iff q

__Tautology and Contradiction__
- Tautology(恒真式,重言式): A compound proposition that is __always true__, no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it.
- Contradiction: A compound proposition that is __always false__
- Contingency: A compound proposition that is __neither__ a tautology nor a contradiction.
Logical Equivalances:
- The compound propositions p and q are called logically equivalent, denoted by(记作) p $\equiv$ q or p $\Leftrightarrow$ q, if p $\leftrightarrow$ q is a tautology
- two compound propositions are equivalent if they always have the same truth value.

De Morgan's Laws:	
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lnot(p\lor q) \equiv \lnot p \land \lnot q \\
\lnot(p\land q) \equiv \lnot p \lor \lnot q
\end{aligned}$$
Identity laws:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \land T \equiv p \\
q \lor F \equiv F
\end{aligned} $$
Domination laws:
$$
