***Proposition(命题)***: a declarative(声明性) sentence that is either true or false (not both)
- Declarative sentence: a sentence that makes a statement, while it does not ask a question or give an order  
- Either true or false: fixed(固定); no variable involved
**Truth value** of a proposition:
- true, denoted by T 
- false, denoted by F.
**Propositional variables**: variables that represent propositions(like p,q,r,s...)
__Compound Propositions(复合命题)__:
- Negation $\lnot$ 
- Conjunction
- Disjunction 
- Exclusive or 
- Implication
- Biconditional
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Negation } &\lnot
\text{Conjunction } &\land
\text{Disjunction } &\lor
\end{aligned}
$$
Negation$\lnot$
Tautology and Contradiction
- Tautology(恒真式,重言式): A compound proposition that is __always true__, no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it.
- Contradiction: A compound proposition that is __always false__
- Contingency: A compound proposition that is __neither__ a tautology nor a contradiction.
Logical Equivalances:
- The compound propositions p and q are called logically equivalent, denoted by(记作) p ≡ q or p ⇔ q, if p ↔ q is a tautology
- two compound propositions are equivalent if they always have the same truth value.
