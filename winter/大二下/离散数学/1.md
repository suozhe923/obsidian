***Proposition(命题)***: a declarative(声明性) sentence that is either true or false (not both)
- Declarative sentence: a sentence that makes a statement, while it does not ask a question or give an order  
- Either true or false: fixed(固定); _no variable_ involved
**Truth value** of a proposition:
- true, denoted by T 
- false, denoted by F.
**Propositional variables**: variables that represent propositions(like p,q,r,s...)
__Compound Propositions(复合命题)__:
- Negation $\lnot$ 
	$\lnot$p is read "not p"
- Conjunction(And) $\land$
	p$\land$q is "p and q"
- Disjunction(Or) $\lor$
- Exclusive or $\oplus$
- Implication $\to$
	p $\to$ q is 
	- if p, then q
	- p implies q
	- p is sufficient for q
	- q is necessary for p
	- q follows from p
	- p only if q
	The converse(逆命题) of p → q is q → p.
	The contrapositive(逆否) of p → q is ¬q → ¬p.
		逆否命题有着相同的 truth value
	The inverse(否) of p → q is ¬p → ¬q.
- Biconditional $\leftrightarrow$
	- p if and only if q
	- p is necessary and sufficient for q
	- if p then q, and conversely
	- p iff q
